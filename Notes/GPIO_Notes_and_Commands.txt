GPIO is your standard pins that can be used to turn devices on and off. For example, a LED.
I2C (Inter-Integrated Circuit) pins allow you to connect and talk to hardware modules that support this protocol (I2C Protocol). This protocol will typically take up two pins.
SPI (Serial Peripheral Interface Bus) pins can be used to connect and talk to SPI devices. Pretty much the same as I2C but makes use of a different protocol.
UART (Universal asynchronous receiver/transmitter) is the serial pins used to communicate with other devices.
DNC stands for do not connect, this is pretty self-explanatory.
The power pins pull power directly from the Raspberry Pi.
GND are the pins you use to ground your devices. It doesnâ€™t matter which pin you use as they are all connected to the same line.

Set up I2C pins:
sudo raspi-config
6 - Advanced Options
A7 I2C - Enable
